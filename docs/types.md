**Strengthening**

Strengthening an element can work in a variety of ways.

*Self-Cast*

Casting a move that strengthens an element or is of the same element to a teammate can strengthen their next attack of that type.

*Enemy-Cast*

Casting a move that *strengthens* an element or is of the *same* element to an enemy can strengthen their next attack of that type.

**Element Combinations**

Elements can combine to form new elemental moves. For example, if a enemy or teammate was to cast an earth spell onto a water user, their next water attack
will be a "Mud" attack. 

## Roles

**Tank**

The role of a *Tank* character is to act as a shield for their team. Their main job is to protect against any incoming damage, to take the attention of the enemy, and to provide occasional boosts to the party. These characters will be slower but more defensive in nature. There are two subcategories of tanks, main tank and off tank. The main tank will be responsible for the brunt of the attention from the enemy and tanking the damage. These characters will have low damage values but high resistances. These characters can also provide buffs to the team like attack speed or morale buffs (similar to a last stand perk). The off tank is responsible for taking over the job of the main tank when the main tank needs a break. While they aren't doing the job of the main tank, they will be dealing more DPS (this will be determined by a stance change from off to main), able to move faster, and have priority on targeting smaller enemy types when a boss is present.

**DPS**

The role of a *DPS* character is to output as much damage as possible. These characters are naturally very squishy but can pump out the maximum amount of damage. They should live on the knife's edge balancing the large amounts of damage with the fear of their fragility. This role can be split up into two subcategories, melee and ranged. Both subcategories have their own strengths and weaknesses. While ranged characters are somewhat out of harms way most of the time, they tend to have a lower burst damage. Ranged DPS characters can be thought of as damage over time characters that can provided a steady output. Melee DPS characters on the other hand output the maximum amount of burst damage while making sure to not get hit. They receive the maximum risk but also the maximum reward. 

**Healer**

The role of a *Healer* character is to support the other characters as much as possible. These characters are an in-between of the Tank and DPS class in terms of resistances and health. These characters tend to be able to survive a hit or two more than DPS characters but still need to watch their health. Healers can be split into two subcategories, warlocks/witches and mages. Warlocks/Witches will be responsible for buffing the team in various ways while also adding debuffs to the enemies. These nasty spellcasters can buff the team by providing move speed, damage buffs, and critical hit buffs while also providing debuffs to the enemy that can range from poison to lower resistances to slower action/movement speed. Mages are oriented to help their team as much as possible. These spellcasters don't have much interest in the enemies but more so their friends in the party. They will be able to heal members of the team either individually or party wide, they can boost movement speed, attack speed, damage output, critical hit chance, resistances, regenerate energy and mana, and boost the dodge chance of characters.

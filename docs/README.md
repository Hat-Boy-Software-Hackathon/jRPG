## Game Design Ideas List

Description: 

This is a **jRPG** project that will be focused on first producing a series of boss fights
for the player to battle through. The player's team will consist of different characters that
have been "collected". Here are the following ideas for the game design: 

- Battle items (heals, damage upgrades, etc...)
- Level Ups for Characters (will boost base stats)
- Evolutions (this can be a full evolution that can unlock different move sets etc or change fighting style)
- Unlockable moves based on level / boss fights beaten (aka a reward like boss drop)
- Fighting Types (could be elemental, could be DPS/Tank/Healer, could be physical vs magic)
- Resistances / Negations (magic resist, armor, armor pen, magic pen, etc, elemental clashes)
- Character Swapping
- Multi-character battles (2v2, 3v3, 4v4, etc...)
- Status effect moves (sleep, stun, etc)
- Could do a role select/swap system, for example you could pick a formation (lets use 3-1-3 as an example) where you have 3 tanks 1 healer, 3 dps and you can swap people in and out of those roles (this would be similar to how dungeons are dealt with in some online jRPGMMOs)
- Super moves (could be something that charges up over time, maybe combo moves or charging a meter)
